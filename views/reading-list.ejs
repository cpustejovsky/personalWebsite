    I like to <strong>really</strong> understand what's going on under the hood
    of a language. That's what drew me to this series, to really understand
    what's going on with JavaScript. I've finished the introductory book and the
    one on Scope and Closures

    Currently, I am working through <strong>this & Object Prototypes</strong>.

    Not really "reading", but a nice overview of computer science to get my feet
