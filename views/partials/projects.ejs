<h1>Projects</h1>
<p>
    The best way to learn is be doing and building. One of my weaknesses is that I
    try to be a perfectionist and procrastinate. The beautiful thing is that
    programming doesn't allow for that. I can't just read about JavaScript or
    NodeJS, I have to build something to really learn it. So here is a growing
    list or probjects I am working on:
</p>

<h4>Estuary</h4>
<strong>Estuary is currently a ME_N app that I built to record stream of consciousness writing and
    notes/to-dos.</strong>
<p></p>
<p>This app is where I've put my NodeJS and MongoDB skills to the test. I've set up routes, built models and schemas,
    learned how to send emails and schedule cron jobs inside the app. I'm also setting up unit tests with Mocha and
    deploying with MongoDB Compass and Heroku.</p>
<p>During Thanksgiving weekend 2019, I started reading
    <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Getting-Things-Done-Stress-Free-Productivity/dp/0143126563" target="_blank"
       rel="noreferrer">Getting Things Done by David Allen</a>.
    During the plane ride, I had the idea to turn my note taking app, Estuary, into an app that could facilitate the GTD
    process.
</p>
<p>That would have the dual benefit of cementing these practices for me and also building a robust app that I can
    proudly show off in my portfolio.

<h4>Twitter Bot</h4>
<p>I spend too much time on Twitter so to minimize that time while keeping up with the people and organizations I want to, I started work on a twitter bot. I've published it as an NPM module which is running on this site and sends me an email at 6:00 AM EST everyday with the tweets I want, having already liked them and providing me the option to retweet and reply via a link.</p>

<h4>GDPR Toggler</h4>
<p>Love it or hate it, GDPR is a reality for businesses so I created a jQuery script to dynamically display an opt-in
    option for countries where that option was required (I used this <a
            href="https://community.unbounce.com/t/how-to-use-geotargeting-to-display-a-visitors-location-on-a-page/5739"
            target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">AJAX script</a> to determine the country by IP address). <strong>This was my first real
        taste of working with jQuery.</strong> The scripts would need customization for the countries and for the
    specific assets that are being displayed or hidden.</p>

<h4>Public/Private Key Signing App</h4>
<p>Application I worked on to better understand cryptography and asynchronous code. <strong>This probject helped me get
        a better understanding of NodeJS's Crypto module.</strong> It should go without saying, but <strong>do not use
        this! I'm rolling my own cryptography here for learning purposes only.</strong></p>

<h4>BitPay Blog Redesign</h4>
<p>As a content writer at BitPay, I guess I took owning the blog a bit too literally and redesigned it. I forked Ghost's
    Casper theme and modified it with the help of an amazing marketing designer to give it a modern look.</p>

<h4>Life Together Calculator</h4>
<p>
    The first application I created which calculated how long my wife and I had
    known each other and showed what percentage of our lives that was. <strong>It gave me hands on experience with
        working with the DOM and JavaScript's Date Object.</strong> I have
    since then made it interactive so anyone with a significant other can
    calculate their life together.
