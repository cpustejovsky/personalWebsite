<p>
  The best way to learn is be doing and building. One of my weaknesses is that I
  try to be a perfectionist and procrastinate. The beautiful thing is that
  programming doesn't allow for that. I can't just read about JavaScript or
  NodeJS, I have to build something to really learn it. So here is a growing
  list or probjects I am working on:

<h4>Life Together Calculator</h4>
<p>
  The first application I created. It calculated how long my wife and I had
  known each other and showed what percentage of our lives that was. I have
  since then made it interactive so anyone with a significant other can
  calculate their life together.

  </ul>

<h4>Estuary</h4>
<p>There is a great site called <a href="https://750words.com/" target="_blank"> 750 Words</a> designed for doing <em>morning pages</em>. I ended up using it to get all my thoughts out in one place. My goal with Estuary is to create an app that records a stream consciousness writing session, but with the functionality to record and save any important things I think of while typing.</p>

<h4>Public/Private Key Signing App</h4>
<p>Application I'm continuing to work on to better understand cryptography and asynchronous code. It should go without saying, but <strong>do not use this! I'm rolling my own cryptography here for learning purposes only.</strong></p>

<h4>GDPR Toggler</h4>
<p>Love it or hate it, GDPR is a reality for businesses so I created a jQuery script to dynamically display an opt-in option for countries where that option was required (I used this <a href="https://community.unbounce.com/t/how-to-use-geotargeting-to-display-a-visitors-location-on-a-page/5739" target="_blank">AJAX script</a> to determine the country by IP address).It would need customization for the countries and for the specific assets that are being displayed or hidden.</p>
