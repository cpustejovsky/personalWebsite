        I'm Charles Pustejovsky. I'm working to align my career path with my
        <strong>ikigai</strong>. Ikigai is something you're passionate about,
        talented at, can have a career in, and can help the world with.

        After years of searching and learning,

            >I realized my ikigai is programming.</a
          ></strong
        >
        Since then I've been learning as much as I can about computer science,
        JavaScript, and how to use code to create things that help myself and others.
      </p>
      <p>
        I'm a self-taught software engineer looking for a <strong>full-stack</strong> or <strong>back-end</strong> developer role to put my passion and skills to work.
