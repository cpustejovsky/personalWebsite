  <h1>Reading List</h1>
  <h3>You Don't Know JavaScript</h3>
  <p>
    I like to <strong>really</strong> understand what's going on under the hood
    of a language. That's what drew me to this series, to really understand
    what's going on with JavaScript. I've finished the introductory book and the
    one on Scope and Closures
  </p>
  <p>
    Currently, I am working through <strong>this & Object Prototypes</strong>.

  <h3>Crash Course Computer Science</h3>
  <p>
    Not really "reading", but a nice overview of computer science to get my feet
    wet before diving deeper into algorithms, data structures, and how CPUs work
    under the hood.
