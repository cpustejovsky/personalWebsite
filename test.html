    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>
      I'm a perpetual learner. I love learning new things and exploring new
      ideas. I never get bored even when reading a SCOTUS statement or an
      academic essay on grain shipments or the most dry technical documentation.
    </p>
    <p>
      One of the things I love most about programming is that it forces me to
      <strong>learn by doing</strong>. I can't just read about programming, I
      have to program. It take me out of my comfort zone in the most delightful
      way. Programming helps me fail fast and learn and grow from those
      mistakes.

        >I'm not scared of asking stupid questions and showing that I don't know
        it all because that's the only way I'll grow, both as a person and as a
        developer.</strong
